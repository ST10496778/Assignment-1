COMMENT ON CODE

In the code below, I Decare the first variable which was the button pick or select button, this enabled me to create the function of the click listener in order to declare my other variables and link it with the pick or selection button.
Within the click listener functions I declared ,3 variables, which is the Clear button, the input day edit text view as well as the suggest text view 
Right after that I set up the click listener button for the clear button, which clears the suggestion text and also the clears the input day edit text 
 

Below is where the case statements are implemented. The user gets an input as a string, in order to check if the input is null or empty to prevent the code from not running. The user can now input the time of day, and the response will be then outputted to them. If the user had to input morning into the app, the outputted text will be bacon and eggs with apple juice, if the user had to input mid-morning into the app, the outputted response would be Avocado and toast and the list goes on until the user inputs the wrong time of day which will result in invalid response from the app
